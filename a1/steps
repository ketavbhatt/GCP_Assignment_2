Create VPC with custom subnet:
- Custom subnets
- Single subnet with range 192.168.1.0/24 in region us-central-1

Create firewall for bastion host:
- Network should be the created VPC
- Direction INGRESS
- priority 1000
- action ALLOW 
- rules tcp:22
- source-ranges 59.152.53.203/32 (Allows only ssh from your terminal!)
- target-tags bastion-host (Important)

Create firewall for private instance:
- Network should be the VPC just created
- Direction INGRESS
- priority 1000
- action ALLOW 
- rules tcp:22
- source-tags bastion-host (Important)
- target-tags allow-ssh-private (Important)

Launch bastion host instance:
- region us-central1
- zone us-central1-c
- service account should have following permissions:
    compute.instances.setMetadata
    compute.projects.setCommonInstanceMetadata
    compute.projects.get
    compute.instances.get
In Management, security, disks, networking, sole tenancy under networking tab:
- network-tag bastion-host
Edit the existing network interface:
 - Network should be the created VPC
 - Subnetwork should be the created subnet

Launch private instance:
- region us-central1
- zone us-central1-c
In Management, security, disks, networking, sole tenancy under networking tab:
- network-tag allow-ssh-private
Edit the existing network interface:
 - Network should be the created VPC
 - Subnetwork should be the created subnet
 - External IP None

On local terminal:
local-terminal:~$ gcloud beta compute --project "pe-training" ssh --zone "us-central1-c" "<bastion-host-instance-name>"
On bastion host:
bastion-host:~$ gcloud beta compute --project "pe-training" ssh --zone "us-central1-c" "<private-instance-name>" --internal-ip

Check for internet access:
private-intance:~$ curl example.com (Should timeout)
